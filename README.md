## ✨ Highlights

* **Real‑time Protection** — Monitors file system and process behavior to stop suspicious encryption attempts before data is locked.
* **Safe Backup & Restore** — Automated, versioned backups with one‑click restore.
* **Threat Alerts & Logs** — Instant notifications with detailed event history.
* **Multi‑language UI** — English + Urdu (easily extensible).
* **Lightweight** — Optimized resource footprint; designed for 24/7 protection.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Always keep offline backups for critical data. No single tool guarantees 100% protection against evolving threats.
